<h4>Cookies</h4>
<h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
<p class="about">We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="about">This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>
<p class="about">The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
<p class="about">If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
<p class="about">When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>

<h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
<p class="about">You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support.

<h4>Social media links via graphics or text link</h4>
<p class="about">We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The integration takes place via a linked text of the respective site. The use of these text links stored on our own servers prevents the automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their display. Only by clicking on the corresponding link will you be forwarded to the service of the respective social network.</p>
<p class="about">Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will be processed in the United States.</p>
<p class="about">Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged into your user account on that network, however, the network operator might assign the information collected about your visit to our site to your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this information can be stored in your personal user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent this, you need to log out of your social media account before clicking on the link. The various social media networks also offer settings that you can configure accordingly.</p>
