<p class="about">Hi, my name is Sebastian and I am a Software Developer from Germany.</p>
<p class="about">I am currently working for <a href="https://www.daimler-tss.com/">Daimler TSS</a>, a <a href="https://www.daimler.com/">Daimler AG</a> subsidiary, in Stuttgart (Germany) as Software Developer. 
	Most of the time I am interested in backend development and operations, but some excursions into the frontend development are also welcome.</p>
<p class="about"> Born and raised in and around Stuttgart, my passion for cars, especially Mercedes Benz, developed early. After finishing my high school (german: Gymnasium), there was only one university to go: University of Stuttgart.
	The decision between Material Science and Software Engineering was a hard one, but at the end I decided to go with Software Engineering (which was the right decision).</p>
<p class="about"> During my studies, I got a student trainee at Daimler TSS and after finishing my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering I joined Daimler TSS as a Software Developer. 
	This was (and still is) a dream come true, working for the company I am so passionate about.</p>
