<p class="about">Hi, my name is Sebastian and I am a Software Developer from Germany.</p>
<p class="about">I am currently working for <a href="https://www.daimler-tss.com/">Daimler TSS GmbH</a>, a <a href="https://www.daimler.com/">Daimler AG</a> subsidiary, in Stuttgart (Germany).
	My interests are mainly focused on backend development and operations, but I also like frontend development for mobile applications.</p>
<p class="about"> Born and raised in and around Stuttgart, my passion for cars, especially Mercedes Benz, developed early. After finishing my high school (german: Gymnasium), I started my Software Engineering studies at the University of Stuttgart.</p>
<p class="about"> During my studies, I got a student trainee at Daimler TSS and after finishing my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering I joined Daimler TSS as a Software Developer. 
	This was (and still is) a dream come true. Working for the inventors of the automobile.</p>
